# 🎥 YouTube Homepage Clone

A clean and responsive **YouTube homepage** built with **HTML5** and **CSS3**.  
This project is part of my front-end development learning journey and showcases my skills in **structuring layouts**, **styling with CSS**, and creating **interactive hover effects**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **static front-end recreation** of the YouTube homepage.  
You can:
- View the main YouTube layout with thumbnails
- Type into a functional-looking search bar (no backend search yet)
- Interact with hover effects on navigation buttons

> ⚠️ This is a visual/UI project only. It has no backend functionality or video streaming — purely design-focused.
