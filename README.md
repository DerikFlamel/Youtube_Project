## 📝 Project Overview

This is a **static front-end recreation** of the YouTube homepage with no backend functionality. The main goal of this project was practice **HTML and CSS extensively**, focusing on mastering HTML syntax and exploring different styling and layout concepts in CSS. It also gave me the opportunity to develop my **UI** and **UX design** skills by studying the fundamentals that large and well-known websites use. 

For the design, I combined elements from **both old and new YouTube layouts** to create something familiar yet unique.
